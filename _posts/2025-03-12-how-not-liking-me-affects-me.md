I lack the ability to liked, I genuinely careless if you like or don't like me. What I'm most considered with is to be understood I didn't say agree. Once we can come to stand that indeed my POV is a thing I'm good. If say I get booed by 1000 people on stage I effortless know how to diffuse such  situations without getting emotional, I could careless about 1000 people booing me. The flip side of being booed will be to get a standing ovation from a freaking 1000 people. Bro in such situations I practically don't know what to do 😂, do I clap with them, do I smile, do try to calm them down so I don't get emotional, do I do backflip out of excitement 😏. Like I freaking don't know what to do.

I was at an event where I was demo the app myself and team built and someone gave a nasty comment, I used the word nasty as per my teams word and I wasn't even offended instead I tried to understand his genuinely POV and when I saw there wasn't I appreciated his opinion and moved on. Same event same spot. Someone spoke about the app and how they had used it for their event and how it made taking questions very easy. I just said thank you. When deep down what i really wanted to say was "WOW! Yo! Dude you really used it for your event i love you too 😂" after thanking and appreciated him I still felt thanking him wasn't enough. So what's the moral of the post or the lesson here. Try out app_name and give you reviews if you genuinely want. Give a good review to make me emotional 😂
