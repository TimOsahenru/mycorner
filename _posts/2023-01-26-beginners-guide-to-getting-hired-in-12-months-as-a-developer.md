In the late quarter of 2022, I received a mail asking for my application for an internship position(paid in dollars), I wasn’t surprised because I expected it, I felt it even took too long 😄 😄, this sense of confidence came because I knew I had put in the work needed, so why some might interpret my fate as mere luck, although it is true, luck did contribute to my success, but also, I was prepared and in search of her(luck) by being deliberate about what I wanted and also by taken some actionable steps.

These deliberate steps to getting you your first job are what I will be sharing in this guide, I’m not promising you a similar outcome as mine, cos I believe yours might even be a better process as to how I started, what I am assuring you of is, if you put in these steps to good use, you’ll see the results within a year, and this brings me to my first tip;

for this article, the lessons learnt and tips shared here can also be used across
any other language, framework or technological concepts as a beginner

### Tip1: Being intentional:
{% highlight linenos %}
Intentional living is the art of making your own choices before other
choices make you.
{% endhighlight %}

I had to be intentional about what part of tech I wanted to start building a career in and for me it was as a backend engineer; one bothered about the flow of logic of an application.

I had researched some of the best languages to learn as of 2021 as a backend engineer and Python was top on that list, it still is as of 2023 according to <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/best-programming-languages-to-learn">hostinger</a>, it takes about 6 months or more to understand the concepts of Python.

When I was sure I understood what it’ll cost me to be proficient in Python as a backend engineer, I committed myself to it, which brings me to our next tip.

### Tip2: Commit yourself:
{% highlight linenos %}
Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans.
― Peter F. Drucker.
{% endhighlight %}

Commitment is the decision to show up every day regardless of the amount of work put in, commitment is in the little steps you take each day towards your plan or goal, commitment is in knowing that consistency beats intensity any time; not focusing too much on the result of perfection but on the process of the journey.

I decided to commit to the goal by intentionaly making this <a href="https://x.com/_osahenru/status/1457799159600193542">tweet</a>

You know, when the universe knows about your plan it finds a way it guides you unto completion, especially if you’re determined to see it through, the old book of wisdom says

{% highlight linenos %}
...Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, That he may run who reads it.
{% endhighlight %}

I put those words into action by making that tweet, tweeting wasn’t the last bus stop, brut work was also needed to be done.

I signed up for a beginners course in <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">computer</a> science I learned programming with scratch for a couple of weeks (say about 4 weeks) on their platform

While many are meant to believe that tech is hard, the lack of a proper road map can even make it harder.

I proceeded to c++ still under the same <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">curriculum(cs50)</a>, not sure how long this took but to follow a plan let's say two months because by February of the following year(2022) I had already narrowed my learning to just Python.

Once I understood the fundamentals of computer programming I narrowed my skill to learning Python with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc">Mosh Hamedani</a>, as my first encounter with the programming language called Python, Mosh’s teaching style is top-notch and very beginners friendly.

After understanding the core concepts of Python; variables, functions, classes, OOP, etc, I was still in search of a beginners guide to learning Python, which brings me to my next tips.

### Tip4: Document your journey
{% highlight linenos %}
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination -

{% endhighlight %}

Documentation is the love language that you write to your future self, it is very important to document your journey as a software engineer, you will always be impressed by how much you have improved when you go back to visit your documentation.

Documenting your tech journey helps you better understand the concepts you are learning and also gives you room to improve on your skill sets as it exposes you to a community of both expert engineers and learners who will benefit from your experience, I’m still shocked at the number of engagement I get on my <a href="https://dev.to/osahenru">dev.to</a> interesting to see that people benefit from me sharing my little wealth of knowledge.

I use my <a href="https://github.com/TimOsahenru">GitHub account</a> not just as a version control system but also to document my projects, which is why I always take out time to write out a proper README file for all my projects(public or private), my <a href="https://dev.to/osahenru">dev.to</a> account and <a href="https://osahenru.hashnode.dev/">hashnode</a> accounts are used to write on whatever concepts I'm learning.

You don’t need to pay for a blog domain as a beginner; these resources are freely available for use.

### Tip5: Effectively belong to a community
{% highlight linenos %}
Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much – Helen Keller
{% endhighlight %}


In May 2022, I searched for some Python handles to follow on Twitter and I stumbled on <a href="https://x.com/PyGhana?t=Vtgu0UPxcsP9ep-CA03svA&s=09">PyGhana</a>, coincidentally they made a retweet about the PyConGhana 22, so I gave a follow on Twitter to find out more about them when I was convinced about understanding the concept of what was nneded to speak at a tech conference <a href="https://x.com/PyconGhana?t=uoTtNZr6u3uPyKasUrfO2A&s=09">PyConGhana</a>, I went ahead to submit a proposal, submitted my first ever CFP and thankfully it was approved.

I understand not everyone enjoys socializing, scary but, somehow being a software developer will force you to socialize in ways that might not suit your personality, just see it as the prize you need to pay.

The decision to give my first talk at a tech conference was very crucial to my journey in landing a job, I met recruiters foreign and local, and had a couple of sincere interactions with developers who were present at the event I could see the gap in knowledge from my end and it challenged me that I can be better and also in the same light I could also see how far I had come as a self-taught developer seeing how much people also benefited from my little knowledge shared.

Well, as you’re reading this I sincerely urge you to become a member of a community regardless of your level of competence.

When you pick a language, search out for the community close to you, the Python community, for example, is a very broad and diverse one, having branches in almost every continent, most countries and major cities and if there are none, this is a call to create one for your locality.

Being active in your community means you are contributing to the community; financial contributions to resources and material, to contributing with your skills and expertise, no matter how small let your presence and impact be felt, and engage their social media handles by commenting and retweeting whenever a post is made.

In[on] the long run, when there’s a job opening, it is most times first circulated amongst these community before they are made public, it is also easier for people to recommend you for a position when you’re an active member of a mutual community.

### Tip6: Market yourself:
{% highlight linenos %}
The price you will offer yourself to the world is how much they will buy you.
― Lailah Gifty Akita
{% endhighlight %}

What makes a story compelling, is how it is being told, to be hired for a position you want to be able to tell a story with your journey on your Twitter, Github or Linkedin profile in a way that is captivating and shows an amazing personality.

How you tell your story on these platforms is more important than your story itself, especially as one with no work experience, you should learn how to constantly share what you’re currently doing/learning, the challenges you faced and how you have overcome those challenges but, be careful not to make another boring writeup, add some personality while you market yourself.

From your display picture to your bio, be very intentional about what you post from now on, see social media as a podium and Twitter(or any other platform) as the mic, what you say and HOW you say it will determine if people would listen to you.

A story gives room for engagement, for example, two developers sharing their story on how they got a job can differ based on how they share their stories.

Why this tip might not seem as portraying the importance of selling yourself as a software engineer, the message I want you to pick is to be very deliberate on how you market yourself by telling your story.

### Tip7: Contribute to an open-source project
{% highlight linenos %}
Your engagement with open is the surest referral to getting your first job.
{% endhighlight %}

An open source project is a project in which its source code has been made public and can be modified, the Django framework is a good example of an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/TimOsahenru/OpenCiviWiki">my first open source project</a> in 2022 exposed me to what a large code base looks like, as a developer it is one thing to read through your code and debug, and yet another to read and try to understand the code of others.

Contributing to an open source project will strengthen your skill in whatever language you're learning as you will be able to see thinking pieces of what makes up the code base you are contributing to.

Also, another benefit of contributing to open source as a beginner is how it exposes you to the working wonders of a version control system.

For how to get started with open source as a beginner, I prepared this <a href="https://dev.to/osahenru/getting-started-with-your-first-open-source-project-5d6m">detailed guide</a>, please check it out.

### Tip 8: Start applying
{% highlight linenos %}
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
{% endhighlight %}

The biggest injustice you can do to yourself is to sit on the sidelines and wait for the perfect time to arrive, the right time for you to start doing what it is you want to do and create what it is you want to create is NOW!

You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great; you don’t need to become a great “developer” before you start applying, ironically you need to start applying to become a great developer in[on] the long run.

Polish your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-osahenru-1a8a9b122/">Linkedin</a> profile, and prepare your resume and a cover letter.

You can start applying on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/">Linkedin jobs</a> or any other job portals, two of the surest positions for a beginner are an internship position or a junior position, and you can get these offers on Linkedin jobs depending on how you have tweaked your Linkedin page.

Besides Linkedin, another platform where you can get jobs is the websites of the companies who are sponsoring some of these tech events, especially those who sponsor the language or framework you’re working with.

So, as a Python/Django developer search for companies sponsoring any PyCon or DjangoCon event close to you or where you would love to work, visit the company's career pages on their website and apply to them, this process is way easier as you’re sure of some of the requirements for working for the company as they are sponsors of your choiced language/framework.

### Tip 9: Believe

but also believe. - Anatole France
{% endhighlight %}

Belief is a practical instrument you need to shape reality, now you have done all the tips earlier highlighted, you must believe it can happen for you and watch it happen.

Move without fear or doubt believing it will work for you, provided you are willing to put in the work as highlighted in this article then believe it will most certainly work for you.

Thankfully November 2022 I got my offer <img src="/assets/images/offer_letter.jpg" alt="Talent Coop offer letter">

I will end with a very beautiful quote from four-time grand slam singles champion, Naomi Osaka

I don't think there's a perfectly correct path to take in life but I always felt that if you move forward with good intentions you'll find your way eventually.

I know it might seem draining on some days but please don’t be discouraged, it worked for me and also it can work for you.

May the odds forever be in your favor.
